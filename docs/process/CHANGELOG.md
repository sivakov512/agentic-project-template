# Changelog

The newest version first. Each entry says what changed and what projects must do, if anything
([updates.md](updates.md#changing-the-process)).

## 0.2.2 — 2026-10-28

- Each stage is written out in `docs/plan.md` at the end of the one before it, from what is known by
  then, with everything it builds on (documents, interfaces, technologies) named and either written
  down already or settled at its start.
  It goes to the owner in the same report as the gate or the stage's last pull requests, so there is
  no new interruption, and the stage starts once it is merged.
- Interfaces between parts that different items build (a data schema, an API, a protocol, a pinout)
  are written down before those items start, once: in a form the parts use directly when there is one
  (a schema file, an API description), otherwise in a document. Leaving one to the code holds only when
  one item builds both sides. The owner reviews them, as stack and architecture.
- Setting up names in the document chain where the interfaces are written; later stages may stay
  brief.

Projects: no change to files; the rules hold from the update on. An item that builds one side of an
interface not yet written waits for an item that writes it; the coordinator adds that item when the
current plan leaves an interface to the code. At the end of the current stage, write out the next one.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-10-25

- The template is under the MIT License. The process files carry the notice in
  `docs/process/README.md`; setting up replaces the template's `LICENSE` with the project's own.

Projects: nothing to do.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-25

- Every project decides how it ships and writes it down: `releases` in `docs/process.json` (required
  once set up) and a Releases section in `docs/plan.md`; setting up asks for it. The process
  recommends release-please run with a GitHub App's token for projects that ship, but doesn't impose
  it.
- `commits.conventional`: the commit check can require Conventional Commits subjects.
- `doctor.py` reads the required approvals and their dismissal from rulesets.
- Process updates come from the coordinator: when `doctor.py` reports a newer release, it runs
  `tools/process/update.py`, which opens the update pull request. The weekly workflow and its
  `PROCESS_UPDATE_TOKEN` secret are gone: a project nobody works on needs no update.

Projects: 0.1.x's `update.py` runs only in the old workflow, so bring this update by hand once: on a
branch `process-update-0.2.0` from an up-to-date `main`, run `python3 <template>/tools/process/sync.py
<template> .` with the template checked out at `v0.2.0`, commit, and open the pull request as
`updates.md` says, with the title and description `tools/process/update.py` writes (`BODY` there:
"Backlog item: Process update", the changelog entries, "Behaviour change: None"). In the update pull
request, set `releases` in `docs/process.json` (how the project ships, `not yet: <where it is decided>`,
or `none`) and add the Releases section to `docs/plan.md`; until `releases` is set, `process-docs` fails
on it. If the project's commits follow Conventional Commits, set `commits.conventional`, drop the
project's own check of them, and reword the commits of open pull requests that don't match. If
`doctor.py` now flags the approvals for `main`, ask the owner to fix the ruleset (`setup.md`, step 8).
The `PROCESS_UPDATE_TOKEN` secret, if the project has one, can be deleted.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-10-24

- Every comment and review on pull requests is in the owner's language, agents' to each other
  included: the owner reads them. The repository itself stays in English.
- In the template itself, the coordinator merges after the owner's Approve.

Projects: nothing to do.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-24

The process of a running agent-driven project, split into the template's part and the project's.

- Rules for agents, roles, stages and gates, how a piece of work goes, pull requests, reports to the
  owner, changes and decision records, the coordinator, defences, the owner's rules.
- Checks: documents (links, backlog, IDs and coverage set in `docs/process.json`, decision records),
  pull request descriptions, commit messages (stricter rules optional), and the lock of the template's
  files, which changes only by moving to a newer version, with the owner's review.
- `doctor.py`, setting up a project or adopting the process in an existing one, the weekly process
  update.
- The "Behaviour change" section, skipping pull requests opened by GitHub Apps, the limit on pull
  request size, found bugs as items of their own.
- The tracker, if any, is chosen at setup and named in `docs/process.json`.
- Each project chooses whether the agents work under an account of their own or the owner's, and
  whether the coordinator or the owner merges.

Projects: nothing to do.
